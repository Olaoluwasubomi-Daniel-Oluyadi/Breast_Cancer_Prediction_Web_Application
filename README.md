# Breast Cancer Prediction Web Application

The Breast Cancer Prediction app utilizes machine learning to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer by analyzing cell measurements. It predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on these measurements. The app features a radar chart to visually represent the input data and displays the predicted diagnosis along with the probability of the mass being benign or malignant. Users can either manually input measurements or connect to a cytology lab to retrieve data directly; note that the app itself does not include laboratory machine integration.

The model was trained using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
